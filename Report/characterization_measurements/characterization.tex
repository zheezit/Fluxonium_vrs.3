\chapter{Calibration}
\subsection{Josephson junction}
we calibrate the josephson junction using 2 probe measurements in order to find the resistance. 


\chapter{Characterization}
    In order to characterize it, one uses: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item SEM  in order to see if we have the right morphology
    \item VNA - vector network analyser in order to calculate the transmission
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization of the Fluxonium qubits}
How would you make the $T_1$ time - coherence time better? 
optiimization that mean reduce noise and make it with longer decoherence time and easy controllable
