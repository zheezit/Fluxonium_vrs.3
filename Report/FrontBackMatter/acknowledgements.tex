\chapter*{Acknowledgements}



% A huge appreciation is expressed to my fantastic supervisors: Emmanuelle Jal and Marcel Hennes who have devoted many hours to help me within every area i possible needed it. Further thanks is given to Renaud Delaunay who has designed and build the \acrshort{moke} and magnetron located at the \acrshort{lcpmr}. Emmanuelle and Marcel have provided invaluable assistance regarding the whole internship and it would not have been the same without their help and good company. I owe them all a huge thanks.
