Over the past twenty years, the field has matured from a predominantly basic research endeavor to one that increasingly explores the engineering of larger-scale superconducting quantum systems. Here, we review several foundational elements -- qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques -- developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics ({cQED}) and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.},

	abstract = {Quantum gate set tomography ({GST}) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography ({QPT}), {GST} self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement ({SPAM}) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than {QPT} as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of {GST} and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of {GST} as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of {GST} and {QPT} using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by {QPT} near quantum error correction thresholds, while {GST} is accurate in this regime.},

The second part describes the quantization of the circuit, with an emphasis on the quantum treatment of dissipation. The final part focuses on the Josephson nonlinear element and the main linear building blocks from which superconducting circuits are assembled. It also includes a brief review of the main types of superconducting artificial atoms, elementary multi-level quantum systems made from basic circuit elements.

It features the automated construction of a symbolic Hamiltonian of the input circuit and a dynamic numerical representation of the Hamiltonian with a variable basis choice. The software implementation is capable of choosing the basis in a fully automated fashion based on the potential energy landscape. Additional features include the estimation of the T1 lifetimes of the circuit states under various noise mechanisms. We review previously established circuit quantization methods and formulate them in a way that facilitates the software implementation. The toolbox is then showcased by applying it to practically relevant qubit circuits and comparing it to specialized circuit solvers. Our circuit quantization is applicable to circuit inputs from a large design space, and the software is open-sourced. We thereby add an important resource for the design of new quantum circuits for quantum information processing applications.},

            This chapter introduces the basic concepts of quantum information processing with superconducting quantum circuits. It starts with a demonstration of how,in these electrodynamic systems, both the superconducting gap and the long-range Coulomb interactions contribute to the existence of collective modesthat have extremely low dissipationand that can be quantized. The chapter also gives in-depth coverage of quantum harmonic oscillators in all their glory from various perspectives. Superconducting qubits are then introduced, starting with the fundamental theory of the Josephson effect and moving on to a presentation of the variety of existing superconducting qubits. Particular attention is given to the dispersive readout of qubits through their interaction with a cavity into which flying modes can be scattered. Finally, the opportunities offered for quantum information processing by employing the cavity as a quantum bus are presented.},

Four Realms of Mechanics In the diagram below, I have sketched out the four great realms of mechanics: Classical Mechanics Quantum Mechanics (Newton) (Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, et al.) Special Relativity Quantum Field Theory (Einstein) (Dirac, Pauli, Feynman, Schwinger, et al.) Newtonian mechanics is adequate for most purposes in "everyday life," but for objects moving at high speeds (near the speed of light) it is incorrect, and must be replaced by special relativity (introduced by Einstein in 1905); for objects that are extremely small (near the size of atoms) it fails for different reasons, and is superseded by quantum mechanics (developed by Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and many others, in the 1920's, mostly). For objects that are both very fast and very small (as is common in modern particle physics), a mechanics that combines relativity and quantum principles is in order; this relativistic quantum mechanics is known as quantum field theory--it was worked out in the thirties and forties, but even today it cannot claim to be a completely satisfactory system. In this book, save for the last chapter, we shall work exclusively in the domain of classical mechanics, although electrodynamics extends with unique simplicity to the other three realms. (In fact, the theory is in most respects automatically consistent with special relativity, for which it was, historically, the main stimulus.)"--},

            Superconducting fluxonium qubits provide a promising alternative to transmons on the path toward large-scale superconductor-based quantum computing due to their better coherence and larger anharmonicity. A major challenge for multi-qubit fluxonium devices is the experimental demonstration of a scalable crosstalk-free multi-qubit architecture with high-fidelity single-qubit and two-qubit gates, single-shot readout, and state initialization. Here, we present a two-qubit fluxonium-based quantum processor with a tunable coupler element. We experimentally demonstrate {fSim}-type and controlled-Z-gates with 99.55 and 99.23\% fidelities, respectively. The residual {ZZ} interaction is suppressed down to the few {kHz} levels. Using a galvanically coupled flux control line, we implement high-fidelity single-qubit gates and ground state initialization with a single arbitrary waveform generator channel per qubit.},

Here, we show that in a fluxonium qubit the role of the {JJ} can also be played by a lithographically defined, self-structured granular aluminum ({grAl}) nano-junction: a superconductor-insulator-superconductor ({SIS}) {JJ} obtained in a single layer, zero-angle evaporation. The measured spectrum of the resulting qubit, which we nickname gralmonium, is indistinguishable from the one of a standard fluxonium qubit. Remarkably, the lack of a mesoscopic parallel plate capacitor gives rise to an intrinsically large {grAl} nano-junction charging energy in the range of tens of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{{GHz}\}\$, comparable to its Josephson energy \$E\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{J\}\$. We measure average energy relaxation times of \$T\_1=10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu s\}\$ and Hahn echo coherence times of \$T\_2{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}text\{echo\}=9{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu s\}\$. The exponential sensitivity of the gralmonium to the \$E\_{\textbackslash}text\{J\}\$ of the {grAl} nano-junction provides a highly susceptible detector. Indeed, we observe spontaneous jumps of the value of \$E\_{\textbackslash}text\{J\}\$ on timescales from milliseconds to days, which offer a powerful diagnostics tool for microscopic defects in superconducting materials.},

For qubits including the Cooper-pair box and transmon, selection rules dramatically restrict the contributions to dispersive level shifts \{{\textbackslash}chi\}. By contrast, without selection rules many virtual transitions contribute to \{{\textbackslash}chi\} and can produce sizable dispersive shifts even at large detuning. We present theory for a generic multi-level qudit capacitively coupled to one or multiple harmonic modes, and give general expressions for the effective Hamiltonian in second and fourth order perturbation theory. Applying our results to the fluxonium system, we show that the absence of strong selection rules explains the surprisingly large dispersive shifts observed in experiments and also leads to the prediction of a two-photon vacuum Rabi splitting. Quantitative predictions from our theory are in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of magnetic flux and reveal that fourth-order resonances are important for the phase modulation observed in fluxonium spectroscopy.},

By cooling down the device in an external magnetic field while crossing the metal-to-superconductor transition, the gradiometric fluxonium can be locked either at \$0\$ or \${\textbackslash}Phi\_0/2\$ effective flux bias, corresponding to an even or odd number of trapped fluxons, respectively.

The strong nonlinearity of the Josephson effect enables one to tailor an anharmonic potential and thus to realize an artiﬁcial quantum two-level system (“qubit”) from a macroscopic superconducting circuit. Josephson qubits can be made to interact strongly and controllably, and it should be straightforward to fabricate circuits incorporating hundreds or even thousands of Josephson qubits using standard thin-ﬁlm processing techniques. Work over the last several years has shown that qubit performance is limited by spurious coupling of the qubit to microscopic defect states in the materials that are used to implement the circuit. Here we discuss the materials origins of dissipation and dephasing in superconducting qubits. A deeper understanding of the underlying materials physics that governs decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits will guide the search for improved, low-noise materials and fuel continued progress in the ﬁeld of superconducting quantum computing.},

Here, the fluxonium qubits are embedded in a multi-chip module ({MCM}), where a classical control and readout chip is bump-bonded to the quantum chip. The modular approach allows for improved connectivity between qubits and control/readout elements, and separate fabrication processes.

	abstract = {We propose and analyze two types of microwave-activated gates between a fluxonium and a transmon qubit, namely a cross-resonance ({CR}) and a {CPHASE} gate. The large frequency difference between a transmon and a fluxonium makes the realization of a two-qubit gate challenging. For a medium-frequency fluxonium qubit, the transmon-fluxonium system allows for a cross-resonance effect mediated by the higher levels of the fluxonium over a wide range of transmon frequencies. This allows one to realize the cross-resonance gate by driving the fluxonium at the transmon frequency, mitigating typical problems of the cross-resonance gate in transmon-transmon chips related to frequency targeting and residual {ZZ} coupling. However, when the fundamental frequency of the fluxonium enters the low-frequency regime below 100 {MHz}, the cross-resonance effect decreases leading to long gate times. For this range of parameters, a fast microwave {CPHASE} gate can be implemented using the higher levels of the fluxonium. In both cases, we perform numerical simulations of the gate showing that a gate fidelity above 99\% can be obtained with gate times between 100 and 300 ns. Next to a detailed gate analysis, we perform a study of chip yield for a surface code lattice of fluxonia and transmons interacting via the proposed cross-resonance gate. We find a much better yield as compared to a transmon-only architecture with the cross-resonance gate as native two-qubit gate.},

A tunable coupler typically includes a nonlinear element, such as a {SQUID}, which is used to tune the resonance frequency of an {LC} circuit connecting two qubits. Here we propose a complimentary approach where instead of tuning the resonance frequency of the tunable coupler by applying a quasistatic control signal, we excite by microwave the degree of freedom associated with the coupler itself. Due to strong effective longitudinal coupling between the coupler and the qubits, the frequency of this transition strongly depends on the computational state, leading to different phase accumulations in different states. Using this method, we experimentally demonstrate a {CZ} gate of 44 ns duration on a fluxonium-based quantum processor, obtaining a fidelity of \$97.6{\textbackslash}pm 0.4 {\textbackslash}\%\$ characterized by cross-entropy benchmarking.},

The relaxation rate at qubit energy values, ranging more than one order of magnitude around the thermal energy \$k\_B T\$, can be quantitatively explained by a combination of dielectric loss and \$1/f\$ flux noise with a crossover point. The amplitude of the \$1/f\$ flux noise is consistent with that extracted from the qubit dephasing measurements at the flux sensitive points. In the dielectric loss dominant regime, the loss is consistent with that arises from the electric dipole interaction with two-level-system ({TLS}) defects. In particular, as increasing Josephson energy thus decreasing qubit frequency at the flux insensitive spot, we find that the qubit exhibits increasingly weaker coupling to {TLS} defects thus desirable for high-fidelity quantum operations.},

We present a tunable coupler that realizes strong inductive coupling between two heavy-fluxonium qubits, each with \${\textbackslash}sim50\${MHz} frequencies and \${\textbackslash}sim5\$ {GHz} anharmonicities. The coupler enables the qubits to have a large tuning range of \${\textbackslash}textit\{{XX}\}\$ coupling strengths (\$-35\$ to \$75\$ {MHz}). The \${\textbackslash}textit\{{ZZ}\}\$ coupling strength is \${\textless}3\${kHz} across the entire coupler bias range, and \${\textless}100\$Hz at the coupler off-position. These qualities lead to fast, high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates.

With the recent demonstrations of multiple high ﬁdelity two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers.

	abstract = {Superconducting qubits are a leading system for realizing large scale quantum processors, but overall gate fidelities suffer from coherence times limited by microwave dielectric loss. Recently discovered tantalum-based qubits exhibit record lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. Here we perform systematic, detailed measurements of superconducting tantalum resonators in order to disentangle sources of loss that limit state-of-the-art tantalum devices. By studying the dependence of loss on temperature, microwave photon number, and device geometry, we quantify materials-related losses and observe that the losses are dominated by several types of saturable two level systems ({TLSs}), with evidence that both surface and bulk related {TLSs} contribute to loss. Moreover, we show that surface {TLSs} can be altered with chemical processing. With four different surface conditions, we quantitatively extract the linear absorption associated with different surface {TLS} sources. Finally, we quantify the impact of the chemical processing at single photon powers, the relevant conditions for qubit device performance. In this regime we measure resonators with internal quality factors ranging from 5 to 15 x 10{\textasciicircum}6, comparable to the best qubits reported. In these devices the surface and bulk {TLS} contributions to loss are comparable, showing that systematic improvements in materials on both fronts will be necessary to improve qubit coherence further.},

              As the superconducting qubit platform matures towards ever-larger scales in the race towards a practical quantum computer, limitations due to qubit inhomogeneity through lack of process control become apparent. To benefit from the advanced process control in industry-scale {CMOS} fabrication facilities, different processing methods will be required. In particular, the double-angle evaporation and lift-off techniques used for current, state-of-the-art superconducting qubits are generally incompatible with modern-day manufacturable processes. Here, we demonstrate a fully {CMOS} compatible qubit fabrication method, and show results from overlap Josephson junction devices with long coherence and relaxation times, on par with the state-of-the-art. We experimentally verify that Argon milling—the critical step during junction fabrication—and a subtractive-etch process nevertheless result in qubits with average qubit energy relaxation times

              reaching 70 µs, with maximum values exceeding 100 µs. Furthermore, we show that our results are still limited by surface losses and not, crucially, by junction losses. The presented fabrication process, therefore, heralds an important milestone towards a manufacturable 300 mm {CMOS} process for high-coherence superconducting qubits and has the potential to advance the scaling of superconducting device architectures.},

	abstract = {Josephson tunnel junctions are the centerpiece of almost any superconducting electronic circuit, including qubits. Typically, the junctions for qubits are fabricated using shadow evaporation techniques to reduce dielectric loss contributions from the superconducting film interfaces. In recent years, however, sub-micrometer scale overlap junctions have started to attract attention. Compared to shadow mask techniques, neither an angle dependent deposition nor free-standing bridges or overlaps are needed, which are significant limitations for wafer-scale processing. This comes at the cost of breaking the vacuum during fabrication, but simplifies integration in multi-layered circuits and implementation of vastly different junction sizes and enables fabrication on a larger scale in an industrially standardized process. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of a subtractive process for the fabrication of overlap junctions. In an array of test contacts, we find low aging of the average normal state resistance of only 1.6\% over 6 months. We evaluate the coherence properties of the junctions by employing them in superconducting transmon qubits. In time domain experiments, we find that both, the qubit life- and coherence time of our best device, are, on average, greater than 20 μs. Finally, we discuss potential improvements to our technique. This work paves the way toward a more standardized process flow with advanced materials and growth processes, and constitutes an important step for the large scale fabrication of superconducting quantum circuits.},

Current shadow-evaporation techniques for aluminum-based Josephson junctions require a separate lithography step to deposit a patch that makes a galvanic, superconducting connection between the junction electrodes and the circuit wiring layer. The patch connection eliminates parasitic junctions, which otherwise contribute signiﬁcantly to dielectric loss. In our patch-integrated cross-type junction technique, we use one lithography step and one vacuum cycle to evaporate both the junction electrodes and the patch. This eliminates a key bottleneck in manufacturing superconducting qubits by reducing the fabrication time and cost. In a study of more than 3600 junctions, we show an average resistance variation of 3.7\% on a wafer that contains forty 0:5 Â 0:5-cm2 chips, with junction areas ranging between 0.01 and 0.16 lm2. The average on-chip spread in resistance is 2.7\%, with 20 chips varying between 1.4\% and 2\%. For the junction sizes used for transmon qubits, we deduce a wafer-level transition-frequency variation of 1.7\%–2.5\%. We show that 60\%–70\% of this variation is attributed to junction-area ﬂuctuations, while the rest is caused by tunnel-junction inhomogeneity. Such high frequency predictability is a requirement for scaling-up the number of qubits in a quantum computer.},

In this perspective, we review recent progress in the path towards such novel qubit designs. After a short introduction and a brief digression about the historical roadmap that has led to the experimental state-of-the art, the emphasis is placed on superconducting qubits based on semiconductor nanowires},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction ({QEC}) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},
