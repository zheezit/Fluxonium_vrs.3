The conclusion is, 
\\
Fluxonium should be theoretically better at.... 
\\
But so far experiments from the laboratores ... have not been able to experimentally fabricate fluxonium qubits so the theoretical advantage have been expressed. 
\\
Maybe in the future Amalie Paulsen will optimize the fabrication of Fluxonium such that the theoretical advantages is highlighted ;)
